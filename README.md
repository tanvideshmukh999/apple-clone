# HTML
In this project, HTML served as the foundation for building the structure and layout of the Apple website clone. Various HTML elements were used to create essential components, such as the navigation bar, product sections, banners, and footer. The semantic HTML tags (like <header>, <nav>, <section>, <article>, and <footer>) were employed to ensure a well-organized and meaningful structure, making the clone more accessible and easier to maintain.
# css
CSS played a crucial role in styling the Apple website clone and making it visually appealing. It was used to replicate Apple's clean and modern design, including typography, colors, buttons, and animations. CSS Flexbox and Grid were used to create a responsive layout that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, ensuring the clone looks great on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. Additionally, CSS was used to implement hover effects, image sliders, and transitions, giving the site an interactive feel similar to the original Apple website.
